## metalmorposis
Distributed async runtime in rust, with a focus on being able to build computation graphs (specifically auto-diff).

examples can be found in examples directory.

## Weird place to have a todo list...
- Maybe rename MorphicIO back to Distributed or distributable.
- Think of a better name than "program". It's more like a node, or smth.
- examples/math.rs (AutoDiff)
- src/network.rs (distribute that bitch)
- I removed wakers again
- What was the point of all these lifetimes again?
